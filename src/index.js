/*
 * Q1. (*)
 * Hamming Distance
 * The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number
 * of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other
 * words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change
 * one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have
 * transformed one string into the other. In a more general context, the Hamming
 * distance is one of several string metrics for measuring the edit distance
 * between two sequences.

/*
 * Q2.
 * Knuth–Morris–Pratt Algorithm
 * The Knuth–Morris–Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches
 * for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" T by employing the
 * observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient
 * information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination
 * of previously matched characters.

/* Q3.Longest Common Substring Problem
 * The longest common substring problem is to find the longest string (or strings)
 * that is a substring (or are substrings) of two or more strings.
 *
 * Example
 * The longest common substring of the strings ABABC, BABCA and ABCBA is string
 * ABC of length 3. Other common substrings are A, AB, B, BA, BC and C.

/*
* Q4. Binary Search
* In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic
* search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value
* within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of
* the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and
* the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with
* the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

/*
* Q5.
* Primality Test
* A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime.
* Among other fields of mathematics, it is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization,
* primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number
* is prime or not. Factorization is thought to be a computationally difficult problem, whereas
* primality testing is comparatively easy (its running time is polynomial in the size of the input).
